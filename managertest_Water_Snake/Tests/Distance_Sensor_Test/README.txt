This test looks at creating a box and a sphere.  The box has a sensor attached to it that projects outwards towards
the sphere.  The distance between the sensor and the sphere is reported by determining the collision point from
ODE and logged.  Results can then be plotted to determine whether or not the reading is correct while the box
rotates back and forth.
