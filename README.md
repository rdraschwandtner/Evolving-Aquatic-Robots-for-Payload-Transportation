# Evolving Aquatic Robots for Payload Transportation
 Using Genetic Algorithms to optimize a robot's configuration for a transportation task.

## Abstract
Payload transportation in an aquatic environment is usually performed by underwater robots equipped with controller boards. The focus of this thesis
is an investigation regarding control strategies for the payload transportation task as executed by a snake-like robot. Both engineered (hand-coded)
controllers and evolved controllers are employed to produce effective robotic behaviors. The robot has been designed to resemble a water snake and comprises
a number of rigid bodies (links) and actuated hinge-joints. For this work, the payload transportation task is defined as: the ability for the snakelike
robot to deliver a spherical target object while operating in an aquatic environment. In contrast to conventional aquatic robots, which are are often
driven by propellers and utilize a robotic arms to grasp objects, the snake-like robot swims and grasps objects by deforming the robot’s body
shape. This behavior is useful in the real world for several reasons. First, the absence of propellers and external devices will reduce the likelihood of
damaging the environment and the robot itself. Second, the robot is less likely to become tangled in debris while moving in the environment. Third,
the robot is less disruptive to the natural environment due to low acoustic noise. All experiments in this thesis are conducted in simulation. Payload
transportation can be broken into the following sub-tasks: (1) approach the target, (2) capture the target, (3) deliver the target. These three tasks are
first investigated individually and then combined to solve the entire payload transportation problem.
In nature, water snakes propel themselves by propagating sinusoidal waves along their bodies. Likewise the snake-like robots in this thesis employ
sinusoidal locomotion patterns in order to generate forward velocity. Sinusoidal parameters are optimized with a genetic algorithm to produce
maximum average speed. Additionally, the steering algorithm utilizes forward momentum to direct the robot toward the target object. An engineered
“grasping” algorithm can be executed when the robot is near the object. Once the robot has grasped the object, it executes a similar swimming/
turning behavior with the object in tow. Finally, the robot releases the object at a destination zone.
A goal of this research is to assess the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms for optimizing payload transportation. Whereas many evolutionary computation studies focus on solving single tasks, this thesis combines engineered
solutions with results from evolutionary runs to realize a complex behavior including multiple sub tasks.

## Methodology Overview
Overview of involved components. Shape Visualizer is used for the algorithm design on a local computer. Experiments are implemented in
Python by using the libraries ODE, MultiNEAT and DEAP. Evolutionary experiment runs are deployed on a HPC through a SFTP connection. Result
data is retrieved after the evolutionary runs finished. The result data is analyzed with MATLAB scripts and visualizations are generated by using
the WebGl-Based Visualizer at http://jaredmmoore.com/WebGL_Visualizer/visualizer.html.
